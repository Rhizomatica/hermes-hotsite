            WHY WE BUILT HERMES?
        </div>
        <div class="body">
            Together with social organizations and
            remote communities in the Amazon rainforest,
            we have been dreaming about, designing, testing
            and building HERMES since 2017 to create reliable,
            secure, long- range, autonomous voice and digital
            communications.

            LONG-DISTANCE COMMUNICATIONS
        </div>
        <div class="body">
            Powered by HF radio, HERMES enables voice and
            data communication over vast distances (hundreds
            of kilometers) with very low power consumption and
            without the need for Internet or satellites. It can be
            installed practically anywhere.

            SECURE COMMUNICATIONS
        </div>
        <div class="body">
            As an option, HERMES uses state of the art encryption
            and password protection to keep communications safe
            from prying eyes and ears. It is also compatible with
            HAM radio regulations as all security
            features are optional and software-configurable.

        <div class="body">
            Due to its low power usage and small
            size, HERMES can be installed in both
            mobile and fixed remote monitoring
            settings, such as boats or weather stations,
            to send real-time GPS coordinates, photos and
            whatever other information is needed.
